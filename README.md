# milestone-two
The second milestone project for Udemy's python bootcamp. 

In this milestone project I created a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.

## The requirements:

* Create a simple text-based BlackJack game
* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
* The player can stand or hit.
* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
* Keep track of the player's total money.
* Alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc.
* And most importantly: the game must use OOP and classes in some portion.
